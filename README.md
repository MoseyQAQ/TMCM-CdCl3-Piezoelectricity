## Wiki

We have also made a public wiki that explains how to calculate the piezoelectric tensor at finite temperature:

## Other Notices

To calculate the bond vector for TMCM molecules, we developed a custom LAMMPS plugin, which is open source at:
https://github.com/MoseyQAQ/ferrodispcalc

This package provides:
1. Fast neighbor list construction.
2. Calculation of polarization or displacement for ferroelectrics (supports LAMMPS plugin for real-time access in LAMMPS).
3. Post-processing tools, e.g., plotting dipole orientation in real space.
